# Python Video Render in Terminal

I created this project using opencv and curses libraries. Used opencv for reading camera and convert image to black and white. Used curses for create live frames in terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/kavi97-boss/python-terminal-video.git
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Enjoy with this, Have Fun😁!!!
